I was born in Uruguay, living in Brazil planning to live in Canada.

I am a civil engineer starting my studies in the area of programming at @rocketseat-education in the explorer course with the objective of implementing programming in my career or even making a complete career transition.

I have experience in the area of project planning and construction management.

I played in the Brazilian national rugby team and had the opportunity to participate as a player in the world university olympics in Kazan - Russia.
